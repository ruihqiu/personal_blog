Half years ago, I visited Munich for one week. It is Bavaria's capital, flat and wealthy. I could not really say I like it or not. However, it is not a bad feeling that being surronded by crowd of different people. Chris invited me to a famous Beer house in downtown. After a glass of beer, he asked if I have any plan to move here. I hesitated a bit and said, "well, Bremen is not that bad, except the cold, wet, windy winter".

On the way back, I passed by a bridge. There are many railways under it, they extend until the end of the horizon, and the sun was slowly going down over there. People climb up on the brige and sit in a long line. Most of them are couples, drinking, smoking, laughing and kiss. The hot red sunset is shining on their faces, slowing cuting out their shadow. I stood there for a long while, a bit envious about these people with happiness.

I asked Youzhe, should I move to Munich? He told me, when you are asking this question, you already have an answer in mind. He is a monk, he already know what I want, just did not tell. We went on a road trip through Netherland and Belgium, had a lot of good time during the trip. He had to move back to Taiwan to continue his study. He told me, everyone is a passenger, no one will travel all along with you, at some point you have to separate and go towards your own direction.

Saying goodbye to him, I also decided to move. Although I had moved many times, from China to France, to Belgium, to Germany, moving is tough for me. I had to throw away half of my belongings. In the meantime, my landlord tried to deduct my deposit, had to fight with him. When I arrived Munich, I started struggle to look for an appartment, it was much harder than I imaged. I was so busy to get settle down, until now, I got no chance to return to that bridge, to watch a beautiful sunset.



半年前在慕尼黑呆了一个星期，巴伐利亚的首府，平整，富饶。并没有特别喜欢或者不喜欢。只是觉得很久没体会，消失在人群里的感觉，倒也不差。我顺着下班高峰的人流，到市区附近一家很出名Beer House。这次是老板请客，我便敞开喝，也敞开聊，几杯啤酒下肚，他问我是否有搬到这里的打算，我倒没有多想，只说：北边还挺好的，只是风太大。

离开的路上，经过一座桥，桥下是很多条铁道，直直的延到天边，恰好被夕阳截住。人们都爬到桥的高处，坐了一整排，三三两两的，喝酒抽烟，谈笑拥抱。火红的夕阳，好像在慢慢地裁剪着他们的身影。我呆呆地站了一会儿，心里默默地羡慕着能够生活在这里的人。

彻底搬离北方，我也纠结了很久。我问有晢，我应该搬吗？他倒是一语道破说，你问这个问题的时候，你心里其实有答案了。他是个出家人，好像生来就知道怎么给答案，又或者他已经看穿我心底的憧憬。我那时候感叹，生活就是一场泥沙俱下的洪流，扎不住根的我，只能随波逐流，总是妄想着，下一站有更好的风景。

虽然已经很熟练搬迁，但也是个痛苦的过程。丢弃了一半的随身物，搬离时房东的百般刁难，到这里艰难地找房子，找到房子发现每天要公交转地铁上班，慢慢地适应新的工作环境和节奏。到现在也还没再到那座桥上，看看久违的落日。

我不爱社交，在这里除了同事，就只认识Y，我们还蛮聊得来，喜欢一起喝酒。记得某天黄昏，我们坐在路边的酒馆。夕阳从她背后一点点落下去，也像那天的桥上一样，慢慢地剪着她的影子。我要用手挡住阳光才能看清她的脸，我抬着手，有些出神，好像只要我把手放下，她就会变回影子，在太阳落下的时候消失掉。后来她真的消失了，我再也没见过她。

但那一刻，我应该是幸福的，像所有能够生活在这座城市的人一样。
